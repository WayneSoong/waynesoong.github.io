I am a Ph.D candidate at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu), supervised by Prof. [Lei He](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/lei-he/) in the ECE department and Prof. [Yingâ€‘nian Wu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~ywu/) in the Statistics department. I receive my B.S. degree from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn) in 2017.

My research interests primarily focus on the field of **Deep Generative Models**. Specifically, my work involves developing efficient and integrated deep generative techniques for cross-domain and cross-modality image translation. I am particularly interested in exploring cutting-edge unsupervised generative approaches, such as **cross-domain/modality translation**, **adversarial learning**, **MCMC teaching**, and **score learning**.

I am also a reviewer for NIPS-23, ICLR-23([Notable Reviewer](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2023/Reviewers)), CVPR-23([Outstanding Reviewer](https://cvpr2023.thecvf.com/Conferences/2023/OutstandingReviewers)), IJCAI-23, ICML-23, and MICCAI-22,23.
